Development may be required to implement a [plugin](plugins) or even to contribute to Hermes core.

This section contains the documentation to get started.

## Coding style

Before submiting a pull request to merge some code in Hermes, you should ensure that :

- it has been formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- it provides [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) and [type hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)
